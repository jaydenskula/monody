            Before I could do any animation, I needed references. Natural movement and fluidity are very important as so the movement does not look stiff 
            or weird. I reached out to a close friend of mine, <b>El Jors</b>, who has a black Newfoundland and asked for video references for various 
            motions including: running, walking, jumping, sitting, laying down. I took the videos and split them up into individual
            frames to use as direct references for animation.

            I learned a lot about Unity this week and I also found some new resources/programs that I could potentially use for my project.

            Time is a very valuable resource for me this semester, and unfortunately I lost a lot of it from visiting my parents over the weekend.
            I made progress on the background art. Unfortunately, I was not able to do as much as I would have liked with the animation because I had to
            overhaul my animatic twice this week. Fortunately, however, I created a jumping animation, updated the menu screen in Unity, and worked
            out the exact size of my tutorial level for the game. I also started working on the background art for the tutorial level. I collected resources
            and references for assets I need for my game.

                Below I have summarized all of the feedback received for the HX Testing Round I.

                            Having "something" calling out to Atlas is not relatable to the audience. If something "called out" to Atlas, that implies a higher power and
                            the message of the story would be lost (Monody is a story about healing from grief, I do NOT want my story to tell the audience "if you're
                            depressed, "God" will reach out and help you")

                        <li>
                            Atlas needs to find purpose by themselves, not have it beamed from the great beyond

                    I learned a lot more about good storytelling and the general process I need to follow to build my story up and tell it in an organic

            <p class="section-text">
                The story went through a major overhaul this week. I scrapped my solution that I proposed last week. My proposed story last week was that months after
                Atlas loses their owner, a light calls to them and leads them to an abandoned greenhouse. Upon receving feedback and critique on this story point,
                I decided to go back to my original idea where the garden was tended by Atlas and they stopped after their owner died.
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                The garden will be Atlas's /thing/. Atlas started the garden, but their owner enhanced the experience. Atlas started and maintained the garden for their 
                own sake and they will restore it, not for their owner, but for themselves. After their owner passes, Atlas finds it hard
                to continue taking care of the garden because of the devastating loss of their partner who supported them and helped them in their own pursuits. But,
                after some time, they will continue their personal pursuit of caring for the garden.
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                The end of my game will feature Atlas planting seeds on their owner's grave, which blossom into beautiful flowers.

            The only things I did not accomplish this week were importing the jumping animation into Unity and completing the in-game greenhouse background.
            I integrated the feedback I received by. I learned about background design and a bit about Unity. I also found a new resource that I will 
            talk about below in the Art & Animation section. I have been working non-stop on Monody, however life is chaotic and I lose a lot of time
            from random things popping up. I also struggle with ADHD, which can be very debilitating.

                Since the story is now finalized, major strides in the writing are no longer required. This week I brainstormed with
                a couple of people to build upon the story that I have set and spent a little bit of time considering minor details that will enhance
                the writing and experience. For example, I decided that the cutscene will show Atlas and their owner planting a special flower. Months 
                later, when Atlas returns to the greenhouse, that flower will still be alive, and it will be the reason Atlas ultimately begins restoring
                the greenhouse. This element will provide emotional continuity for the viewer, as well as a more rounded story.

                This week was heavy with art and animation. The painted backgrounds below took a total of 3 hours. One of this week's goals was to animate
                Atlas walking in the cutscene. It does not look like much, but this took a tremendous amount of time, especially since the timing of the
                frames had to be readjusted occasionally.

                I did a couple of hours of work in Unity this week. First off, I coded the ability for Atlas to pick up and drop items, as I want the
                tutorial level to require this mechanic. It is not perfect, but it works and can be fine-tuned later. The other aspect I implemented was
                the walking cycle animation whenever the player is moving. I was pleased to see that it looks good. There are a couple of unwanted
                behaviors dealing with the animation (it does not stop immediately when the player stops moving), but that can and will be troubleshooted
                in the future.

                Megan Leahy is my mentor for my animation for Monody. I have checked in with her a couple of times to review my animatic. The first time around she
                suggested I make the scenes feel more lively by having silhouettes walking around in the background. The second time around, she suggested I added
                ambient animations to the stills that will be present in my cutscene. Even though the stills will not be actively animated, I need to have movement and
                life present as it will feel out of place if the shots are entirely stagnant. I believe using a combination of CSP and Adobe After Effects may be an
                effective and powerful way to combine tools to create a final cut that I am truly proud of.

                he wanted to make sure I have a clear idea of a couple of key things in my story:
