            Before I could do any animation, I needed references. Natural movement and fluidity are very important as so the movement does not look stiff 
            or weird. I reached out to a close friend of mine, <b>El Jors</b>, who has a black Newfoundland and asked for video references for various 
            motions including: running, walking, jumping, sitting, laying down. I took the videos and split them up into individual
            frames to use as direct references for animation.

            <b>HamRum</b> is one of my closest friends and she offered to produce the music for Monody. We worked in tangent with each other. She completed

        <p class="section-text">
            I accomplished more in Unity than expected this week. I set up some basic movement controls (left, right, jump) and imported some assets
            for testing. I began brainstorming ideas for the tutorial level and opening puzzle for the game.

        <p class="section-text">
            I accomplished almost everything I wanted to this week. Unfortunately, I was not able to complete all the sketches for the cutscene that I wanted.
            I always keep the feedback I receive in mind when I am working on my project.
            I learned a lot about Unity this week and I also found some new resources/programs that I could potentially use for my project.

            <p class="section-text">
                For round 1 of the HX Testing, I approached people that I planned to get feedback from with information about the current state of my story and animatic.
                Below I have summarized all of the feedback received for the HX Testing Round I.

                <p class="section-text">Feedback: Ollie Oxenfree</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Having "something" calling out to Atlas is not relatable to the audience. If something "called out" to Atlas, that implies a higher power and
                            the message of the story would be lost (Monody is a story about healing from grief, I do NOT want my story to tell the audience "if you're
                            depressed, "God" will reach out and help you")
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Atlas needs to find purpose by themselves, not have it beamed from the great beyond
                        </li>
                        <li>Atlas must have agency. Atlas (and by extension, the player) having agency is the key to making the story work</li>

                            Have Atlas pick up the scent of their owner which leads them to a cemetery. An item that once belonged to the owner

                            The animatic, as it was, did not properly communicate what was happening (Atlas' owner dying) to the audience. It looked as if Atlas was 
                            simply bored and had nothing to do
                        </li>

            <p class="section-text">
                The story went through a major overhaul this week. I scrapped my solution that I proposed last week. My proposed story last week was that months after
                Atlas loses their owner, a light calls to them and leads them to an abandoned greenhouse. Upon receving feedback and critique on this story point,
                I decided to go back to my original idea where the garden was tended by Atlas and they stopped after their owner died.
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                The garden will be Atlas's /thing/. Atlas started the garden, but their owner enhanced the experience. Atlas started and maintained the garden for their 
                own sake and they will restore it, not for their owner, but for themselves. After their owner passes, Atlas finds it hard
                to continue taking care of the garden because of the devastating loss of their partner who supported them and helped them in their own pursuits. But,
                after some time, they will continue their personal pursuit of caring for the garden.
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                The end of my game will feature Atlas planting seeds on their owner's grave, which blossom into beautiful flowers.

                Because the story was overhauled the animatic followed suit.

            <P class="section-text">
                The music's production is in tangent with the art and animation. The animatic was having major adjustments done this week, 
                and because of this, no new music was created.
