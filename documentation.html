            Before I could do any animation, I needed references. Natural movement and fluidity are very important as so the movement does not look stiff 
            or weird. I reached out to a close friend of mine, <b>El Jors</b>, who has a black Newfoundland and asked for video references for various 
            motions including: running, walking, jumping, sitting, laying down. I took the videos and split them up into individual
            frames to use as direct references for animation.

            Time is a very valuable resource for me this semester, and unfortunately I lost a lot of it from visiting my parents over the weekend.
            I made progress on the background art. Unfortunately, I was not able to do as much as I would have liked with the animation because I had to
            overhaul my animatic twice this week. Fortunately, however, I created a jumping animation, updated the menu screen in Unity, and worked
            out the exact size of my tutorial level for the game. I also started working on the background art for the tutorial level. I collected resources
            and references for assets I need for my game.

                            Having "something" calling out to Atlas is not relatable to the audience. If something "called out" to Atlas, that implies a higher power and
                            the message of the story would be lost (Monody is a story about healing from grief, I do NOT want my story to tell the audience "if you're
                            depressed, "God" will reach out and help you")

                        <li>
                            Atlas needs to find purpose by themselves, not have it beamed from the great beyond

                    I learned a lot more about good storytelling and the general process I need to follow to build my story up and tell it in an organic

                    I need to know the answer to when writing a story.

            <p class="section-text">
                The story went through a major overhaul this week. I scrapped my solution that I proposed last week. My proposed story last week was that months after
                Atlas loses their owner, a light calls to them and leads them to an abandoned greenhouse. Upon receving feedback and critique on this story point,
                I decided to go back to my original idea where the garden was tended by Atlas and they stopped after their owner died.
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                The garden will be Atlas's /thing/. Atlas started the garden, but their owner enhanced the experience. Atlas started and maintained the garden for their 
                own sake and they will restore it, not for their owner, but for themselves. After their owner passes, Atlas finds it hard
                to continue taking care of the garden because of the devastating loss of their partner who supported them and helped them in their own pursuits. But,
                after some time, they will continue their personal pursuit of caring for the garden.
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                The end of my game will feature Atlas planting seeds on their owner's grave, which blossom into beautiful flowers.

            The only things I did not accomplish this week were importing the jumping animation into Unity and completing the in-game greenhouse background.
            I integrated the feedback I received by. I learned about background design and a bit about Unity. I also found a new resource that I will 
            talk about below in the Art & Animation section. I have been working non-stop on Monody, however life is chaotic and I lose a lot of time
            from random things popping up. I also struggle with ADHD, which can be very debilitating.

                Since the story is now finalized, major strides in the writing are no longer required. This week I brainstormed with
                a couple of people to build upon the story that I have set and spent a little bit of time considering minor details that will enhance
                the writing and experience. For example, I decided that the cutscene will show Atlas and their owner planting a special flower. Months 
                later, when Atlas returns to the greenhouse, that flower will still be alive, and it will be the reason Atlas ultimately begins restoring
                the greenhouse. This element will provide emotional continuity for the viewer, as well as a more rounded story.

                This week was heavy with art and animation. The painted backgrounds below took a total of 3 hours. One of this week's goals was to animate
                Atlas walking in the cutscene. It does not look like much, but this took a tremendous amount of time, especially since the timing of the
                frames had to be readjusted occasionally.

                I did a couple of hours of work in Unity this week. First off, I coded the ability for Atlas to pick up and drop items, as I want the
                tutorial level to require this mechanic. It is not perfect, but it works and can be fine-tuned later. The other aspect I implemented was
                the walking cycle animation whenever the player is moving. I was pleased to see that it looks good. There are a couple of unwanted
                behaviors dealing with the animation (it does not stop immediately when the player stops moving), but that can and will be troubleshooted
                in the future.

            Unfortunately, I did not get nearly as much done as I would like to this week. A combination of stress, burnout, and art block has impeded my ability
            to work efficiently on my project, and I believe I need a little bit of help to get myself back on track.

                A majority of my work this week was spent painting backgrounds for my animation. I completely overhauled my forest background to make it more

            I got a whole lot done this week and I am proud of myself. My time management was very good and I covered almost everything I wanted to get done.
            Having time blocks for all of my goals helped my productivity, but I didn't follow them exactly.
            The only thing I did not do this week was work on idle plant animations, which I have decided are low priority and I will make them if time permits.

                I worked on all the assets that I need for my deliverable. While they are not complete, I made good progress and the painting
                process should not take too much time.

                One of my goals for this week was to complete at least one background for the cutscene. While it is near-complete, I simply did not have
                the time to do everything I wanted. However, it is close to being done, it just needs some cleaning up and I need to add shadows. Below
                I have a comparison of what the forest background looked like last week and the current version.

                The only goal I did not touch upon this week was adding text in Unity. I am starting to feel the stress and pressure, and I'm well aware
                that I need to start speeding things up and doing more every week. Things are still coming along though, and I hope that there are minimal
                distractions this week for me to get as much done as possible. I share my progress with several people every week who give me feedback
                on my work. I take all feedback into account going forward. One big thing I learned this week is that I cannot let my emotions distract me.
                It was unexpected, but the current political turmoil has been largely distracting and stressful for me, preventing me from being as
                productive as possible. I hope that I don't run into the same issue this week.

                Megan Leahy is my mentor for my animation for Monody. She is an instructor at CU Boulder and she is currently my professor for motion design.
                I have checked in with her to review my animatic. She suggested I make the scenes feel more lively by having silhouettes walking around in the background 
                during the town scene. She also suggested I added ambient animations to the stills that will be present in my cutscene. Even though the stills will not 
                be fully animated, I need to have movement and life present as it will feel out of place if the shots are entirely stagnant. I believe using a 
                combination of CSP and Adobe After Effects may be an effective and powerful way to combine tools to create a final cut that I am truly proud of.

                I have been talking extensively with Ollie the past several weeks about Monody and its story. Ollie is a professional and creative writer, who is very
                knowledgeable on the fundamentals of storytelling and narratives. The advice that Ollie has given me is extensive. When talking to him about Monody,
                he wanted to make sure I have a clear idea of a couple of key things in my story:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>What kind of story do I want to tell?</li>
                <li>What is my message to the audience?</li>
            </ul>

                <p class="section-text">
                    Almost all the advice that Ollie has given me revolves around these questions. I have also asked for general perspectives about writing and storytelling.
                    A small bit of their response to this is shown below.
                </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                A couple of weeks ago, I altered the story so that a light called out to Atlas that leads them to an abandoned greenhouse that they decide to restore.
                Ollie warned that this route will tell a completely different story and will have implications that do not fit the scope of what I want Monody to be about.
                While having a light calling out to Atlas would be an easy storytelling point, it is a cheap one. It is harder to write other ways for the story to go
                but the payoff will be far more satisfying at the end of the story. With this feedback, I decided to go back to my original story idea, i.e. Atlas and their
                owner had a garden that Atlas restores. I made some changes with CU faculty's criticisms in mind.
                But as Ollie pointed out, this story route brings up another vital question: <b>What is the final motivator for Atlas to overcome their depressive rut 
                and start taking care of the greenhouse again?</b> Ollie had me brainstorm 3 possible story outcomes, which ended up looking like this:

            <p class="section-text">
                Ultimately, I decided to go with the first idea. After the main crux of the story was handled, Ollie has since then helped me tighten my 
                narrative to make it stronger and more effective.
