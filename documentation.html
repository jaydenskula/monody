        <p class="section-text">
            Before I could do any animation, I needed references. Natural movement and fluidity are very important as so the movement does not look stiff 
            or weird. I reached out to a close friend of mine, <b>El Jors</b>, who has a black Newfoundland and asked for video references for various 
            motions including: running, walking, jumping, sitting, laying down. I took the videos and split them up into individual
            frames to use as direct references for animation.

            <b>HamRum</b> is one of my closest friends and she offered to produce the music for Monody. We worked in tangent with each other. She completed
            temp music for the menu screen of Monody.

        <p class="section-text">
            I accomplished more in Unity than expected this week. I set up some basic movement controls (left, right, jump) and imported some assets
            for testing. I began brainstorming ideas for the tutorial level and opening puzzle for the game.
